                <h3><span>1 . </span> LIONEL MESSI</h3>
                <p>Messi might be the king of club football, but it's been a different story for his Argentina career. He was sent off after two minutes of his debut in 2005 and famously quit international football in 2016 after losing three finals in three
                    years. Happily, he changed his mind, and Argentina would surely not have qualified for Russia without him; they are no "one-man" team, but do depend greatly on Messi. At least he should be fresh for this World Cup after Barcelona's
                    early Champions League exit. — TIM VICKERY</p>

                        <p>It is rare nowadays for a player to become a superstar without having played club football in his own country, but that is the case for Griezmann. When he won the Europa League this season in Lyon, only 70 kilometers from his hometown
                            of Macon, there was an element of showing Ligue 1 teams what they had missed. — JULIEN LAURENS </p>

                            Championship appearances; he can boost his status by impressing at his first World Cup. — MICHAEL YOKHIN</p>
